        \item{Part of a greenfield project with a medium-sized team. Built new processes from the ground up 
        to accommodate a new set of workflow and administrative management tools, communicating with the existing 
        system to allow product personalisation. We integrated with third-party software and hardware to allow 
        automated bottle engraving, artwork composition, printing and product assembly.}
        \item{Analysing system performance, proposing and delivering work to automate and optimise manual
         processes or improve scalability and responsiveness to align with peak period needs. Made use of 
         new technologies, mentored a group of new members and started covering scope, documentation of system 
         design and implementation of new features.}
         \item{Acquired an adaptive skillset, including accurate assessment and quick turnaround in events with 
         high potential impact. Among the tools that help me successfully manage each major incident is leveraging 
         scripting to identify and provide fixes for such situations. Using a versatile, general-purpose scripting 
         language such as python allows me to narrow down the source of the problem in an emergency and to supply 
         temporary, ad-hoc solutions when required.}
