    \item{I started as a Graduate Software Engineer working for the outbound team of the WMS, through to the
    Software Engineer level and more recently started on a leadership development path. I got involved in
    incidents and started participating in the on-call shift rotation early (2 years+), being the point of
    contact to resolve any major incidents arising during the shift. Further develop a leadership progression
    by identifying personal areas to improve, such as stakeholder management and seeking regular feedback on
    my work. Was in charge of interviewing, onboarding, developing and mentoring individuals.}
